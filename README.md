🚀 What's Inside?
In this project, we’ve built a conversational chatbot using Spacy — a cutting-edge NLP library that powers the understanding of text. This bot can respond intelligently based on the data you provide!

🔍 Key Features:

Text classification using Spacy's deep learning models.
Intent recognition for various user inputs.
Ability to customize and add more intents easily.
Easy-to-understand code with detailed explanations.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Spacy: For natural language processing and training machine learning models.
Python: The heart of this project — coding the logic for our chatbot.


💡 How It Works
Training: The bot is trained using sample data containing intents (such as "greeting", "goodbye", etc.) and their corresponding responses.
Natural Language Understanding: Spacy's NLP model is used to parse and understand your input.
Intent Recognition: Based on what you say, the bot identifies your intent and gives an appropriate response.
