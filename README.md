🤖 Chatbot Using Spacy
Welcome to the Chatbot using Spacy repository! 🎉 Here, you'll find a powerful chatbot built using the Spacy NLP library that allows you to interact with a bot like never before. Get ready to explore, experiment, and improve your skills in natural language processing (NLP)!

🚀 What's Inside?
In this project, we’ve built a conversational chatbot using Spacy — a cutting-edge NLP library that powers the understanding of text. This bot can respond intelligently based on the data you provide!

🔍 Key Features:

Text classification using Spacy's deep learning models.
Intent recognition for various user inputs.
Ability to customize and add more intents easily.
Weather information update: The chatbot can now provide weather-related responses when asked!
Easy-to-understand code with detailed explanations.


💡 How It Works
Training: The bot is trained using sample data containing intents (such as "greeting", "goodbye", etc.) and their corresponding responses.
Natural Language Understanding: Spacy's NLP model is used to parse and understand your input.
Intent Recognition: Based on what you say, the bot identifies your intent and gives an appropriate response.
Weather Information: The bot now provides weather-related responses! Ask the bot about the weather, and it will give you a basic response related to weather queries (like "What's the weather today?" or "Is it raining?").
